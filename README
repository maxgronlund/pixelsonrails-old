== This is a configuration template

all the most common gemfiles is installed and configred

example on how they are used is implemented


Q: how to integrate :validate with user edit so it'n not necessary to retype password when updating
Q: first time all images should be cropped to fit defined sizes, 
maybe an example on how to pass 

1: crop to same image ratio as (something defined)
2: crop next after crop


note: cropping belongs on individual page since it's saved immediately
